            "Mon4": "When berry season arrives, there's more than enough food to go around.#$e#You just have to know how to look for them, and they come in abundance.",
            "Mon6": "There's nothing like the feeling of making it through another winter with just the gifts of the mountain.$h",
            "Mon8": "Me? Married? Haha, no, I've never been married.$h#$e#I've never demanded that anyone else should conform to my lifestyle.",
            "Tue2": "Is there something that you want?",
            "Tue6": "A long time ago, yes, I grew up in a family. I haven't seen them for many years.#$e#I don't think I can even remember their faces anymore...$s",
            "Tue10": "Well, @, I suppose I could consider you a part of my new family, if that's alright.$h#$e#Oh, please don't be alarmed. The trees, the rocks, the lake, the sky... they are all my family, too.",
            "Wed4": "This land will continue to exist for many eons past our lifetimes.#$b#Please do treat it with respect.",
            "Thu": "...Hmm? Do you want something from me?",
            "Thu2": "...Maybe I need to pack up my tent and move again.$s",
            "Thu6": "Yes, you saw me taking food from the trash cans that one time...$s#$e#Usually, I just live on the food that nature provides, but the food that others throw out goes to complete waste if I don't take it.$s#$e#Is that any way to treat the world that provides for us?",
            "Thu8": "Sometimes, people don't understand me, but that doesn't make them bad.#$e#It just bothers me when they show hostility.",
            "Thu10": "There is a beauty in caring for others.#$b#So if I find something delicious and there's enough for two, I'll leave it in your mailbox.$h",
            "Fri": "Please don't destroy my tent.#$e#It's happened before.$s",
            "Fri2": "Why do you keep visiting me?",
            "Fri8": "Where do we go after we die? I suppose I'll go into the ground.#$e#Just back into the flow of nature, is all.#$e#It doesn't have to be so bad, if you think about it.#$e#I guess I'm not quite ready for that yet, though.$h",
            "Sat": "I'm happy by myself, you know.#$e#I don't need new friends.",
            "Sat2": "...Hello, again.",
            "Sat6": "I don't imagine I'll stay here much longer.#$e#Don't be alarmed if you come up here and my tent is suddenly gone.#$e#That's how I've always done it.",
            "Sat8": "Perhaps I'll stay here another year.#$e#I don't normally stay put in one place for this long, but...$s",
            "Sat10": "At this rate, I may just stay here indefinitely.$h#$e#I can live in nature as much as I want, but I'm not too far away from at least one good neighbor. Thank you, @.",
            "Sun2": "You don't have to speak to me if you don't want to.",
            "Sun8": "When I first met you, @, I was sure I would be leaving the valley soon. Thank you for helping to change my mind.",
            "summer_Tue8": "Marlon and Gil? Yes, I see them every now and then.#$e#We mostly keep to ourselves.",
            "summer_Sun6": "I once caught a bass in the lake that was longer than my arm.$h#$e#That was a long time ago. I don't know that I'll ever break that record.",
            "fall_Mon8": "I'll admit, I've followed you into the mines before, from a distance.#$e#I'm sorry. I just want to make sure you stay safe...",
            "fall_Tue10": "Hi there, @!$h#$e#Find any good foraging spots today?",
            "fall_Wed8": "The mountain owes us nothing, yet it still gives. Anything we take is an undeserved gift. We must never forget to be thankful.",
            "fall_Sun10": "Have you tried fishing with wild bait yet?",
            "winter_Mon6": "I could hide indefinitely from the cold in the hot spring, but that isn't where I live.#$e#I'd rather not step on anyone's toes. The building belongs to the village.",
            "winter_Tue8": "If I play things right, I can go for a week or so without food.#$e#It isn't my first choice, but I can do it if it becomes necessary.",
            "winter_Wed8": "Rasmodius is a good friend. We only run into each other every now and then, but we always pick up where we left off.",
            "winter_Thu8": "The family in that house seemed annoyed by my presence when I first settled here. Lately, though, they seem fine with me.",
            "winter_Sun8": "It's important to know that we don't really matter. The world will carry on whether we humans exist or not.",
            "spring_1_2": "Breathe in that spring air!$h#$b#The valley is coming to life.$h",
            "summer_10": "I think I might take a risk tomorrow at the luau and share a little of my cooking.",
            "winter_15": "I caught a glimpse of the ships docking at the beach, from my view up on the mountain.#$e#Maybe I'll give them a look up close.",
