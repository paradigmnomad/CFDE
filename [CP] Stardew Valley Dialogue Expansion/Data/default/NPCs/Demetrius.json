            "Mon2": "Maru worked hard to get through school early. Now she's studying a variety of sciences independently.#$e#I'm glad that I can provide her the equipment she needs to pursue her future.$h",
            "Mon4": "I'm happy Maru got her job at the clinic. Medicine is a very respectable profession, but I'll be happy with whatever kind of science she ultimately decides upon.",
            "Mon6": "I know that Maru will have to leave the valley eventually. If she got stuck here for too long, it could hinder her potential.$s#$e#For the moment, though, I think her living here works out well.",
            "Mon8": "I can already see Maru's scientific achievements surpassing mine in her future.#$e#I'm very lucky that she's turning out the way she is.$h",
            "Tue2": "Stardew Valley continues to impress me with the diversity of its flora and fauna.#$e#I'm surprised there weren't any other scientists observing the area before I arrived.",
            "Tue4": "Exploring the mines could be interesting, but my fields are ecology and biochemistry, rather than geology.#$e#If we found evidence indicating a significant causal link between the mines and the vegetation up here, well then that would be another story.",
            "Tue6": "The drastic changes between the seasons are crucial for keeping the wildlife migrating...#$b$...which in turn is crucial for preventing one single population from becoming too dominant.#$e#I keep pretty good tabs on the various local species, so I'll let you know if I see anything unusual.",
            "Tue8": "Have you ever visited Calico Desert?#$e#I was more interested in studying the valley's ecosystem, but the fact that we have a desert just a day trip's drive away has remained quite a mystery.",
            "Wed4": "Hi @! How are you doing today?#$e#I wish I could make your farming job easier somehow.",
            "Wed6": "I've been collecting some useful data from that cave on your farm.#$b#It's unique in that it produces flora that are often unavailable in the direct surrounding environment.#$e#We're still years away from determining how to utilize this, though.",
            "Wed8": "Whenever my field research becomes a bit stagnating, I'll admit that I enjoy a little off-the-wall chemistry.#$e#I got my hands on a little cesium a few years ago. Robin said \"never again.\"$h",
            "Wed10": "Sorry, I must talk your ear off from time to time, don't I?",
            "Thu2": "Growing any green beans? One of my favorite comfort foods uses them in a recipe.",
            "Thu4": "There are a variety of sponsors who support my work. It took several years of publication and networking to be able to set up my lab out here.#$e#I did have my sights on Stardew Valley for quite a while.$h",
            "Thu6": "It's no wonder that humans have been farming in this region for countless generations. It takes an environment like this for early man to thrive.",
            "Fri4": "Robin has a hot temper. It's better to stay on her good side.#$e#...now if I could only quantify her mood levels, perhaps I could model the fluctuations using a sinusoidal curve...$u",
            "Fri6": "When I met Robin in college, a lot of my friends were pretty awestruck at my willingness to date someone who's already a mom.#$e#What can I say? We were just a good match.$h",
            "Fri8": "I can't help but analyze the 'why' of everything. The way plants grow, the way food tastes, the reason good art looks beautiful.#$e#But every once in a while, I recognize the need to detach, stop questioning, and simply dance with my wife.",
            "Sat4": "One aim of my research is to figure out the exact environmental conditions that we see here in the valley, that make it so uniquely fertile for such a wide variety of species.#$e#In terms of application, we could use it to bolster the abundance of crop turnouts in less fertile regions.",
            "Sat6": "Greetings, @. How is your work progressing?#$e#If you grow any pristine crops, it would be a privilege to examine them.#$e#And possibly taste them!$h",
            "Sat10": "Have you heard of giant crops? Apparently, if certain crops become so dominant in a wide enough plot of land, there's a small chance for the giant variant to manifest.#$e#Nature almost bred them out of existence, since their size makes them impractical for natural selection.",
            "Sun4": "My work basically is my hobby. Occasionally, though, I'll cook a meal, too.",
            "Sun6": "For Sebastian, I left most of the parenting to Robin.#$e#Even today, it's usually best to stay out of his way and let Robin handle things with him.",
            "Sun8": "Sebastian always seems bored by just about every aspect of my work.$s#$e#Computer science is a science, though. I've always tried to bond with him over that, but there's still a bit of a divide between us.#$e#The books I've read say that's to be expected.",
            "Sun10": "Between you and me, I really thought that Sebastian would have moved out by now.$s#$e#He's even older than I was when I first met Robin...$s#$e#As long as he works and pays his rent, though...",
            "Sun_inlaw_Sebastian": "It's such a relief that Sebastian's finally moved out. I did always think you were a good match for him.$h",
            "summer_Mon6": "Why is it that ice cream tastes so good? Science may never provide an answer.#$e#Ha ha, just kidding. It's the fat and sugar.$h",
            "summer_Tue4": "Fertilizer is best for producing quality crops, but if you need to rush a crop to maturity, use Speed Gro.#$b#In theory, you could get three melon harvests that way, instead of two.",
            "summer_Tue8": "You can use sap and fish to make quality fertilizer.#$e#If it's too time consuming to get the fish, maybe you could catch some snails or periwinkles in some crab pots instead.",
            "summer_Thu4": "Hmm... If strigolactone levels could be increased, would it have a proportional effect on mycorhizal growth?$u#$b#Oh! Sorry. I was pondering some data and I didn't notice you there.#$e#Do you need anything?",
            "summer_Thu8": "I became a scientist because I wanted to contribute to the progression of our species.#$e#Of course, none of this would be possible without farmers such as yourself.$h",
            "summer_Fri": "Do you have any animals on your farm?",
            "summer_Fri2": "$p 40#So I heard Maru had you look through that telescope out back.|If you and Maru become friends, I'm sure she'll show you how to use that telescope out back.#$e#Pretty exciting, huh?",
            "fall_Wed": "Let's see... perhaps the nitrogen fixation level is affected by nematode secretions...$u#$b#Oh! Sorry. I was pondering some data and I didn't notice you there.#$e#Do you need anything?",
            "fall_Thu": "How's the farming business going? It's corn season, isn't it?#$e#I can imagine it being pretty peaceful, working outdoors with plants all day.",
            "fall_Thu6": "Maru sure spends a lot of time working on those gadgets of hers.#$e#I'm glad she's so dedicated.",
            "fall_Thu_inlaw_Maru": "I'm still flabbergasted about Maru's secret robot... was it all a dream?",
            "fall_Sun": "During this time of year I divert my attentions to fungi.",
            "fall_Sun6": "We know a lot about nature thanks to science.#$e#But there's always a lot more to learn.",
            "winter_Wed": "Talk to my wife if you want to increase the size of your house.",
            "winter_Wed4": "Do you have a kitchen in your house yet?#$e#Cooking is kind of like doing lab work.",
            "winter_Sat": "Hello.#$e#%Demetrius seems lost in thought.",
            "winter_Sat4": "Let's see... if seasonal nitrogen levels could be modeled by a piecewise function...$u#$b#Oh! Sorry. I was analyzing data and I didn't notice you there.#$e#Do you need anything?",
            "winter_Sat8": "Feel free to harvest as much lumber and stone from this area as you please.",
            "Event_tomato1": "Really? I figured a farmer would know the correct answer...$s",
            "Event_tomato2": "See? @ agrees with me.",
            "Event_Lab_Silence": "Well, we'd better titrate this solution before it crystallizes on us.",
            "Event_Lab_Rat": "*sigh*... %fork$4",
            "spring_1_2": "Happy new year! Lots of work ahead of both of us.",
            "summer_28": "You got my letter, right? Don't be late! You won't want to wait a whole 'nother year for it.$h",
            "winter_28": "We've completed another rotation around the sun!#$e#That deserves a celebration, it seems.",
