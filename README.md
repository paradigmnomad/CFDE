# Canon Friendly Dialogue Expansion

[Nexus Page](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2544)

Canon Friendly Dialogue Expansion (CFDE) was made by [gizzymo](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/6238934) and coded by [paradigmnomad](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/26612284). Containing over 2400 lines of unique dialogue, CFDE was one of the original major dialogue overhaul mods for Content Patcher. 

## Features
- 1500+ new day-to-day dialogue messages for ALL 33 characters who have a heart level;
- Approximately 600 new marriage dialogue messages across all 12 spouses;
- Unique dialogue for festivals up through year 3, afterwards dialogue is randomized;

## Credits

This mod was inspired by [Seismothesaurus's](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/45651647) [Extended Dialogue for Jodi and Kent](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1288) mod. No word-for-word text is re-purposed from it, however.

`Not Started` means nobody has posted or started work on that translation. `Incomplete` translations are missing large portions of dialogue or are outdated and are not included in the main download. `Complete` translations may have typos/bugs that are not present in the English version but are included in the main download. `In Progress` means somebody has begun work on it. This is subject to change at any time. Translations may be missing any new content added because of 1.5.

If you want to translate CFDE into a language not listed (ex. Polish or Thai) send paradigmnomad a DM.
